## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  ## return: a list containing functions to
  ##              1. set the matrix
  ##              2. get the matrix
  ##              3. set the inverse
  ##              4. get the inverse
  ##         this list is used as the input to cacheSolve()
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    # use <<- to assign a value to an object in an environmente
    # different from the current environment 
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv = function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinv = function() inv
  list(set=set, get=get, setinv=setinv, getinv=getinv)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv = x$getinv()
  
  # if the inverse has already been calculated 
  if(!is.null(inv)){
    # get from the cache and skips the computation
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  # otherwise, calculate the inverse
  mat.data = x$get()
  inv = solve(mat.data, ...)
  
  # set the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinv
  # function
  x$setinv(inv)
  return(inv)
}
